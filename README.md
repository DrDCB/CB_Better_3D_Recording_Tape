Replaces the 3D cassette tape model that briefly appears when capturing/receiving a new monster. Also dynamically switches its colour to match the 2D sprites for standard and bootleg tapes.

As a bonus extra, the tape and player on the title screen can be replaced, using the new tape models from above and a new cassette player model. This is available as a separate optional download.

Download the mod from [ModWorkshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/53375).
